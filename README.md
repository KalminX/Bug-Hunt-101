# Bug Hunt 101 — Recon to Report

## 📌 Project Overview

Bug Hunt 101 is an introductory cybersecurity project designed to simulate a real-world bug bounty workflow in a **safe, local lab environment**.  
The project focuses on reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and professional reporting using a deliberately vulnerable web application.

The goal is to demonstrate **process and clarity**, not the number of vulnerabilities found.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Set up a vulnerable web application locally
- Perform basic reconnaissance on the target
- Identify at least one real web vulnerability
- Exploit the vulnerability safely
- Document findings in a professional security report

---

## 🧪 Test Environment

- **Target Application:** Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
- **Deployment:** Localhost (Docker-based setup)
- **Target URL:** `http://localhost:4280`
- **Security Level:** Low
- **Operating System:** Linux
- **Tools Used:**
  - Nmap
  - Web Browser
  - Docker
  - Text Editor

## 🔍 Methodology

The project follows a simplified bug bounty workflow:

1. **Environment Setup**  
   Confirm the vulnerable application is running and accessible.

2. **Reconnaissance**  
   Identify the target and perform basic network scanning.

3. **Vulnerability Discovery**  
   Test application inputs for common web vulnerabilities.

4. **Exploitation & Proof**  
   Craft payloads to confirm the vulnerability exists.

5. **Reporting**  
   Document the vulnerability with reproduction steps, proof, impact, and mitigation.
